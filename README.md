This group of python files are used to quickly create and load data into a Database.

This will use Mimesis for the names and other non-numeric data points and Numpy for a Gaussian distribution to have a more normalized curve. I like to try to give some realism to my logic algorithms when it comes to simulating data to enhance the result of what I'm working on.
